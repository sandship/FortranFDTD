## Description
In this repo, FDTD method for electro-magnetic calcuration is implemented.

## Introduction
FDTD method, which is finite differential time domain method, is used for some wave analysis, ex; fruid, electromagnetic, acoustic, so on. 
In this repo, we implement Scattered-Field FDTD method.

## Usage
```bash
make
./fdtd.out
```

## Install
```
git pull git@github.com:sandship/FortranFDTD.git
```
